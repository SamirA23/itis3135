                <h3><a href = "https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-14-and-16/">Good Website</a></h3>
                <p>Apple made a fantastic webpage for the MacBook Pro products, nicely
                    detailing their key features with cool graphics.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: Switches between light and dark on the site. It incorporates
                        the use of great contrast. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Repetition: There is little to no repetition with words describing the features 
                        of the products. There is a good amount of repetition of content colors and backgrounds
                        which helps with consistency.
                    </li>
                    <li>Alignment: Everything is formatted properly and is organized</li>
                    <li>Proximity: Big pictures gives better understanding for user about what they
                        are supposed to be looking at.

                <h3><a href = "https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">Bad Website</a></h3>
                <p>Berkshire Hathaway is a company that indulges in many different industries 
                    such as insurance, manufacturing, energy, rail, and retail owned by billionaire
                    Warren Buffett. This website is as bare bones as it gets as it only has links 
                    to their businesses.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: The whole page is white with purple links to Berkshire Hathaway's
                        businesses. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Repetition: There is a type of consistency but not in a positive way. The site
                        is too bland so that the style remains the same with no change throughout.
                    </li>
                    <li>Alignment: The main content of the site is centered whereas the last two 
                        thirds of the footer is way too the left and not formatted correctly. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Proximity: There are not any examples of proximity as everything on this webpage
                        blends in. All of the links are formatted the same and one could not tell the 
                        difference between them. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
